# Stardew-Valley-Unofficial-fix-for-Thyrenoths-Aideen-Seasonal-Portraits
A fix for Thyrenoth's Aideen Seasonal Portraits mod that allows it to work with Poltergeister's Seasonal Cute Characters for East Scarp. This edit allows the former's sprite to take precedence over the latter's sprite. This mod should take precedence over any mod that tries to edit the portrait for Aideen via late priority in content.json.
Required mods to function: SMAPI, Content Patcher, East Scarp
